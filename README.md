Project Title:
Binary Image Classification: Happy vs. Sad

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can classify images into two categories: "Happy" and "Sad". The model will be trained on a dataset containing images of people displaying happy and sad facial expressions.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of images collected from various sources, containing individuals exhibiting either a happy or a sad facial expression. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, with a split ratio of 80:20. Image augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability.

Model Architecture:
The deep learning model used for image classification is based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. MobileNetV2 is chosen for its lightweight design and high efficiency, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. The pre-trained MobileNetV2 model is fine-tuned by adding additional layers, including fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation, dropout regularization, and a final output layer with sigmoid activation.

Training Process:
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and binary cross-entropy loss function. Training is conducted for a total of 30 epochs, with early stopping applied to prevent overfitting. During training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set to monitor its accuracy and loss metrics.

Model Evaluation:
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the validation set. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify images as happy or sad. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the distribution of predicted classes and identify any misclassifications.

Deployment:
Once trained and evaluated, the model can be deployed for real-time inference on new images. The deployment process involves loading the trained model into a production environment, where it can receive input images and generate predictions. The model's performance can be further optimized for deployment by quantizing its weights and converting it to a more efficient format, such as TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

Conclusion:
The developed image classification model demonstrates promising performance in distinguishing between happy and sad facial expressions. By leveraging deep learning techniques and pre-trained models, the project highlights the potential for automated emotion recognition systems in various applications, including sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring. Further improvements and refinements to the model can be explored to enhance its accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios.
